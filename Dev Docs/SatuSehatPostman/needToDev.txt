  Guide Version: 2.0 - Last Updated January 2025
  Total Length: 9,919 lines
  Total Phases: 33 phases (expanded from previous version)

  Key Findings:

  1. Phase 7.14: Financial & Coverage Resources (NEW SATUSEHAT Phase)
  This is a NEW phase between Phase 7.13 (just completed) and Phase 8. It covers FHIR resources for financial transactions and insurance:

  - Coverage Resource: Insurance information (BPJS cards, classes)
  - CoverageEligibilityRequest: SEP request for BPJS verification
  - CoverageEligibilityResponse: SEP response with benefits

  - ChargeItem Resource: Individual service charges
  - Invoice Resource: Consolidated billing invoices
  - Claim Resource: Insurance claims with items
  - ClaimResponse Resource: Insurer claim adjudication
  - PaymentReconciliation Resource: Payment tracking
  - PaymentNotice Resource: Payment notifications

  This phase integrates with:
  - BPJS SEP workflow
  - INA-CBGs grouper codes
  - Financial dashboards

  2. Phase 8: Billing Module (Starting point you selected)

  8.1 Billing Structure:
  - Service tariff master data
  - Room charges calculation
  - Doctor fees structure
  - Procedure costs
  - Medicine charges from pharmacy
  - Laboratory test fees
  - Radiology examination costs
  - Package deals configuration
  - Multiple payment types (cash, insurance, company)

  8.2 Invoice Generation:
  - Automatic charge compilation
  - Discount/tax calculation
  - Deposit deduction
  - PDF invoice generation
  - Invoice void/correction

  8.3 Payment Processing:
  - Multiple payment methods (cash, card, transfer, QRIS)
  - Partial payments
  - Payment receipt generation
  - Cash register integration
  - Refund handling

  8.4 Insurance Claim Management (non-BPJS):
  - Insurance company master data
  - Coverage verification
  - Claim forms
  - Status tracking
  - COB (Coordination of Benefits)

  3. New Phases Added (Phase 14-33):

  - Phase 15: Integration Hub Module
  - Phase 16: Security & Authentication
  - Phase 17: Reporting & Analytics
  - Phase 18-19: React Frontend
  - Phase 20: Testing Strategy
  - Phase 21-22: Deployment
  - Phase 23: Post-Production
  - Phase 24: Advanced Features
  - Phase 25: Compliance and Quality
  - Phase 26: Critical Care & Support Services
  - Phase 27: Medical Records & Quality Management
  - Phase 28: Indonesian Regulatory Compliance
  - Phase 29: Financial & Procurement System
  - Phase 30: Patient Engagement & Digital Access
  - Phase 31: Specialized Clinical Services
  - Phase 32: Hospital Operations Management
  - Phase 33: Support Services & Infrastructure

  Recommendation:

  Before implementing Phase 8 (Billing), you should implement Phase 7.14 (Financial & Coverage Resources) because:

  1. Phase 7.14 provides FHIR resources (Coverage, ChargeItem, Invoice, Claim) that form the foundation for Phase 8's billing system
  2. The SATUSEHAT financial resources integrate directly with BPJS claims processing
  3. Phase 8 will reference these FHIR resources for insurance billing
  4. Logical progression: SATUSEHAT financial APIs → Internal billing system

  Would you like me to implement Phase 7.14: Financial & Coverage Resources first, or proceed directly with Phase 8: Billing Module?

> yes
